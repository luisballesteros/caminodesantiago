# Camino de Santiago

## The Camino de Santiago is a man's thing?

"The Camino de Santiago (Latin: Peregrinatio Compostellana, "Pilgrimage of Compostela"; Galician: O Cami√±o de Santiago),[1] known in English as the Way of St. James, is a network of pilgrims' ways or pilgrimages leading to the shrine of the apostle Saint James the Great in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where tradition holds that the remains of the saint are buried. Many follow its routes as a form of spiritual path or retreat for their spiritual growth" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago]

Pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago is a demanding physical activity. This is probably the reason why historically there were more male pilgrims than female pilgrims.
The trend, however, has been to increase the proportion of women. 
It is possible that this is due to the fact that women practice more sport.
The number of athletic licenses has been chosen as an indicator of the practice of sports.

From the office of the website of the "pilgrim's office" the data from 2004 to 2019 of pilgrims by gender have been obtained.

In the pilgrim's office, people who have traveled at least 100 km and have the pilgrim's card stamped through the places of passage are registered.

On the website of the pilgrim's office you can download summaries of the annual statistics in pdf. From these documents the data of pilgrims by gender that are in the archive have been extracted:

The project has the collaboration of Spanish and regional sports federations. Spanish and regional sports federations.
